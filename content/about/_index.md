## Our Mission

We build AI systems that are trustworthy, efficient, and impactful across diverse domains—from healthcare to edge computing. Our research bridges theoretical foundations with real-world deployment, emphasizing explainability, fairness, and robustness.

<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600; color: var(--primary); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Our Positioning: Honest & Ambitious</p>
<p>Founded in November 2021, we are an emerging research group at Heriot-Watt University. We compete on research quality, mentorship, and work-life balance—not prestige or heritage.</p>
</div>

## What We're NOT

<div class="card-grid">
<div class="card">
<h3>❌ Oxford or Cambridge</h3>
<p>We don't have 100-year heritage or famous professors. We're building our reputation from the ground up.</p>

<div class="card">
<h3>❌ Established Group</h3>
<p>We're young and growing, not a mature lab with decades of alumni.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>❌ Massive Funding</h3>
<p>No £10M+ grants yet. We operate with start-up funding (£160K) and strategic small grants, building our funding portfolio.</p>
