## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Research Group

**Q: Why choose an emerging group instead of Oxford/Cambridge?**

**A:** Honest trade-offs:

You **get**: Personal mentorship (biweekly one-on-ones), work-life balance (enforced 10-hour limit), ground-floor opportunity (shape research direction), clinical impact (real NHS partnerships).

You **don't get**: Famous PI name (yet), 50+ lab alumni network, £10M+ project budgets.

**Our track record**: 0 PhD graduates yet (first expected Sept 2026), but strong publication record (2 Nature Comms 2025), clinical partnerships (BHF Centre, NHS Lothian), and 100% PhD retention (0 dropouts).

---

**Q: How do I verify the 10-hour work limit is real?**

**A:** Ask our current students directly (emails provided after shortlisting). We also:

- Track working hours via weekly check-ins
- Explicitly discourage weekend work
- Schedule meetings only 9am-5pm
- Support mental health with university counseling access

Our philosophy: Research quality comes from focused work, not long hours. Sustainable pace = better science.

---

**Q: What if I struggle or my project doesn't work out?**

**A:** We have support mechanisms:

- **Monthly progress reviews:** Catch issues early
- **Flexible project pivots:** If your initial direction isn't working, we adapt (Year 1-2)
- **Mental health priority:** University counseling, peer support network
- **Exit strategy:** If PhD isn't right for you, we support MRes/MSc exit (Year 2)

Our commitment: **0 forced dropouts.** If you're struggling, we work together to find solutions.

---

### About Requirements

**Q: Do I need prior publications?**

**A:** **No.** Publications are a bonus, not a requirement.

We care more about:
- Strong ML fundamentals (courses, projects, code)
- Research potential (curiosity, problem-solving)
- Cultural fit (work-life balance, collaboration)

---

**Q: What GPA/degree classification do I need?**

**A:** Typically:

- **UK:** First-class Honours (70%+) or strong Upper Second (65%+)
- **US:** GPA 3.5+/4.0
- **China:** 80%+ or top-tier university (C9 League)
- **Other:** Equivalent to UK First-class

Exceptions possible if you have:
- Strong research experience (papers, internships)
- Excellent coding portfolio (GitHub projects)
- Exceptional references

---

**Q: Do I need a master's degree?**

**A:** **Preferred but not required** (UK system).

- **With MSc:** Direct entry to PhD
- **Without MSc:** May require MRes (1 year) before PhD, depending on background

---

**Q: I'm an international student. Am I eligible?**

**A:** **Yes!** 60% of our students are international.

Funding covers both UK and international tuition fees. We support visa applications.

---

### About the PhD Experience

**Q: How many papers should I expect to publish?**

**A:** **Target: 3+ first-author papers** during 4-year PhD.

Realistic breakdown:
- Year 1-2: 1 workshop/conference paper
- Year 2-3: 1-2 top-tier conference papers (MICCAI, CVPR)
- Year 3-4: 1 journal paper (IEEE TMI, Medical Image Analysis)

We prioritize quality (top venues) over quantity (many low-tier papers).

---

**Q: Can I choose my own research direction?**

**A:** **Yes, within the project scope.**

You're not executing a predetermined plan. We co-create research directions based on:
- Your interests and strengths
- Clinical partner needs
- Emerging opportunities (new datasets, collaborations)

Years 1-2: More guided. Years 3-4: More independent.

---

**Q: What happens after my PhD?**

**A:** Our support continues:

- **Academia path:** Postdoc recommendations, job market advice
- **Industry path:** Interview prep, network introductions
- **Entrepreneurship:** Spin-out support if commercializing research

We stay invested in your career long-term.
