## Why This Page Exists

**Transparency & Accountability:**

Many research groups claim "100% job placement" without providing evidence. We commit to:

- **Honest reporting:** We will report actual outcomes, including unemployed graduates if any
- **Consent-based:** Only display information with graduate permission
- **Regular updates:** Annual updates with new graduate cohorts
- **Aggregate statistics:** Report percentages even if individual names aren't consented

**What We're Measuring:**

1. **PhD placement rate** (% pursuing doctoral degrees)
2. **Industry placement rate** (% in ML/AI industry roles)
3. **University rankings** (where students are placed)
4. **Time to employment** (months post-graduation)
5. **Salary ranges** (if graduates consent to share)

## For Prospective Students

**What You Should Ask:**

When evaluating a research group, don't just trust claims—ask for evidence:

- **"What % of your graduates get PhD positions?"** (We will provide exact numbers after March 2026)
- **"Where do your students go after graduation?"** (We will list universities/companies with consent)
- **"Do you have any unemployed graduates?"** (We will report honestly if any)

**Our Commitment:**

- We will never exaggerate outcomes
- We will report failures alongside successes
- We will update this page annually with verifiable data
- We welcome prospective students to contact alumni directly (emails provided with consent)
